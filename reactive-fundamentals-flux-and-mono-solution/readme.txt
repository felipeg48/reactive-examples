[Goals of the lab]

-Getting enough understanding on reactive programming fundamentals
 especially on Reactor 3's Flux and Mono
-Understanding the difference between imperative vs reactive
 programming

[What you will learn]

-How to create Flux and Mono objects from various sources
-How to perform operations (using operators) against a stream of objects
-How to asynchronously handle a stream of objects
-How to perform back-pressure using Subscription object
-How to use scheduler to handle a stream of objects

[APIs/Functionality you will use]

-Flux, Mono, Publisher
-Flux operators such as "filter", "map", "flatMap"
-Flux handler methods such as "doOnNext", "doOnError", "subscribe"
